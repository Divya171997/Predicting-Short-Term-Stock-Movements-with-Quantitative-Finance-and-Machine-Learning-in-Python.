 MSC DISSERTATION
The key purpose and the major concern pertaining to the study is towards determining the best/
suitable model that facilitates in predicting the value of stock market. From the assessing inves
tigating process, there exists several techniques as well as pertinent variables which are essential
for consideration, as it appeared that the these techniques that are discovered by scientists over
the years, like random forest as well as SVMs being comparatively been underutilized. The
study presents us and further emphasises and explores over appropriate approaches that has
more accurately inferred with stock’s movements. The primary consideration concerning with
the data set concerning with stock price on prior year. The dataset achieved was then pre
processed and furthermore developed to its actual analysis. Therefore, this study also focuses
on the data pre-processing for raw form of dataset. Then, follows pre-processing, as we further
discussed how to employ random forests, vector machine support in dataset, and outcomes that
the data produces. In addition, the proposed study will examine the issues which are in associa
tion with that of predictive systems usage under real-world contexts following with determining
accuracy over the given overall ranges. The study also introduces a ML model for predicting
stock for highly competitive range of market. With implementation of successful stock fore
casting could pose as an important asset for stock exchanges and offers concrete solutions for
counteracting problems faced by investors in majority cases.
